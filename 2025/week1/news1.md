1) Google News: AI in Search: Going beyond information to intelligence  (20 Mayıs 2025)

With AI Mode, Google shifts its search engine from a traditional keyword-based system to a more intelligent query processing engine. 
The mode applies a query fan-out technique, breaking a user’s question into subtopics and issuing multiple queries in parallel.
This results in deeper, context-aware answers with source links. Powered by Gemini 2.5,
the system supports multi-step reasoning and multimodal analysis for more advanced search capabilities.
